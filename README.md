# Introduction-to-Computer-Architecture-School-Projects
# All projects were done in MARS a Mips Assembler and Runtime Simulator.

# Project 1 was divided into 3 parts. Part A I had to compute a odd parity of a word and find the value (either 1 or 0). Part B was about reversing the order of bits in a word. Finally Part C was all about division.

# I learned from this project the ability to: 
# ● Understand short problem descriptions for which an assembly-language solution is required.
# ● Use MIPS32 assembly language to write solutions to three such small problems.
# ● Use MARS to implement, simulate and test your solution.
# ● Hand draw a flowchart corresponding to your solution to the first problem.



# Project 2 was about creating different types of morse code messages using the digital lab simulator on MARS. To test the code individually remove any lines that have a single # next to them. Make sure to have the digital lab simulator open (located under tools) to see the morse code.

# I learned from this project the ability to:
# ● Write and use procedures.
# ● Implement parameter passing using registers.
# ● Implement return values using registers.
# ● Use a stack for saving and restoring register values.
# ● Use the “Digital Lab Sim” tool in MARS to experiment with the visualization of morse code.



# Project 3 was divided into 4 parts. Part A was about storing values into a array and printing them out on Run I/O. Part B was about writing code that counted the number of times a, b, c, or d was pushed and output the number on Run I/O. Makes sure to open Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator under to tools section. Once connected to MIPS and the program is running push any key on the keyboard and to end the program push the spacebar. Part C was about using the Bitmap Display (under tools section) to draw boxes with different colors. Part D was about once again using the Bitmap Display but instead to control a box using WASD.

# I learned from this project the ability to:
# ● Use system calls for rudimentary output to the MARS output console.
# ● Write an interrupt handler for the keyboard of the “Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator” tool in MARS, and write a program that takes advantage of the behavior of the handler.
# ● Write a procedure to render a four-pixel by four-pixel box on the “Bitmap Display” tool.
# ● Combine both tools used earlier in this assignment in order to control the movement of a box on the bitmap display
