# Introduction-to-Computer-Architecture-School-Projects
# All projects were done in MARS a Mips Assembler and Runtime Simulator.
# Assignment 1 was divided into 3 parts. Part A I had to compute a odd parity of a word and find the value (either 1 or 0). Part B was about reversing the order of bits in a word. Finally Part C was all about division.
# Assignment 2 was about creating different types of morse code messages using the digital lab simulator on MARS. To test the code individually remove any lines that have a single # next to them. Make sure to have the digital lab simulator open (located under tools) to see the morse code.
# Assignment 3 was divided into 4 parts. Part A was about storing values into a array and printing them out on Run I/O. Part B was about writing code that counted the number of times a, b, c, or d was pushed and output the number on Run I/O. Makes sure to open Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator under to tools section. Once connected to MIPS and the program is running push any key on the keyboard and to end the program push the spacebar. Part C was about using the Bitmap Display (under tools section) to draw boxes with different colors. Part D was about once again using the Bitmap Display but instead to control a box using WASD.
